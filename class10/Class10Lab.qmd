# Intro to the PDB Database

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project: 

https://tinyurl.com/statspdb
```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```

The numbers have commas, making them read as characters. You can use `gsub()` and `as.numeric()` together to change this:
```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
```

```{r}
  as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x) )
```

```{r}
# Turning it into a function
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric( gsub(",", "", x) )
}
```

```{r}
# Apply it to stats
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
pdbstats
```

**Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?**
```{r}
# Total number of structures
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)

# Calculating the percentage for each
round((totals/totals["Total"]) * 100, 2)
```

**Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?**
```{r}
(pdbstats[1, "Total"] /sum(pdbstats[,"Total"])) * 100
```


**Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?**

211,377 structures.


**Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?**

Because hydrogen atoms are too tiny to visualize.


**Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?**

Water 308(the big red circle near MK1 in the photo below).


**Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.**

*Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?*

The protein probably has other configurations that allow larger ligands to enter the binding site.


# The bio3d Package for Structural Bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting Functional Motions in a Singule Structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics model showing how this protein moves.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
