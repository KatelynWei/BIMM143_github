# Clustering

We will start today’s lab with clustering methods, in particular
so-called K-means. The main function for this in R is `kmeans()`.

Let’s try it on some made up data where we know what the answer should
be.

``` r
x <- rnorm(10000, mean = 3)
hist(x)
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

60 points

``` r
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, mean = 3), rnorm(30, -3))
x <- cbind(x = tmp, y = rev(tmp))
head(x)
```

                x         y
    [1,] 3.641652 -1.989152
    [2,] 4.111052 -5.177271
    [3,] 2.985284 -4.103174
    [4,] 2.371921 -3.382637
    [5,] 3.847134 -2.749982
    [6,] 6.043018 -3.368242

We can pass this to the base R `plot()` function for a quick look.

``` r
plot(x)
```

``` r
k <- kmeans(x, centers = 2, nstart = 20)
k
```

    K-means clustering with 2 clusters of sizes 30, 30

    Cluster means:
              x         y
    1  2.991705 -3.300150
    2 -3.300150  2.991705

    Clustering vector:
     [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    [39] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

    Within cluster sum of squares by cluster:
    [1] 68.69916 68.69916
     (between_SS / total_SS =  89.6 %)

    Available components:

    [1] "cluster"      "centers"      "totss"        "withinss"     "tot.withinss"
    [6] "betweenss"    "size"         "iter"         "ifault"      

> Q1. How many points are in each cluster?

``` r
k$size
```

    [1] 30 30

> Q2. Cluster membership?

``` r
k$cluster
```

     [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
    [39] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

> Q3. Cluster centers?

``` r
k$centers
```

              x         y
    1  2.991705 -3.300150
    2 -3.300150  2.991705

> Q4. Plot my clustering results

``` r
plot(x, col = k$cluster, pch = 16)
```

> Q5. Cluster the data again with kmeans() into 4 groups and plot the
> results.

``` r
k4 <- kmeans(x, centers = 4, nstart = 20)
plot(x, col = k4$cluster, pch = 16)
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

Kmeans is very popular mostly because it’s fast and relatively
straightforward to run and understand. It has a big limitation in that
you need to tell it how many groups (k, or centers) you want.

# Hierarchical Clustering

The main function is `hclust()`. You have to pass it in a “distance
matrix”, not just your input data.

You can generate a distance matrix with the `dist()` function.

``` r
hc <- hclust(dist(x))
hc
```


    Call:
    hclust(d = dist(x))

    Cluster method   : complete 
    Distance         : euclidean 
    Number of objects: 60 

``` r
plot(hc)
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

To find clusters (cluster membership vector) from a `hclust()` result we
can “cut” the tree at a certain height that we like. `abline()` adds a
line to a plot and `cutree()` cuts

``` r
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col = "red")
```

![](class07_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)

``` r
grps <- cutree(hc, h=8)
```

``` r
table(grps)
```

    grps
     1  2 
    30 30 

> Q6. Plot the hclust results

``` r
plot(x, col = grps)
```

The row names were not set properly. One way to fix this is to set
`rownames()` to the 1st column, then remove the 1st column with `-1`.
THIS IS DANGEROUS. Re-running the code would delete data.

``` r
rownames(x) <- x[,1]
x <- x[,-1]
head(x)
```

                   England Wales Scotland N.Ireland

    Sugars             156   175      147       139

Instead, we can re-read the data and use the row.names argument to set
it to the 1st column:

``` r
x <- read.csv(url, row.names=1)
head(x)
```

    Cheese             105   103      103        66

The second one because it prevents an accidental error from happening.

``` r
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

The `pairs()` function makes a matrix of scatterplots that compare pairs
of categories at a time(countries in this case). If a point lies on the
diagonal, it means that variable doesn’t differ much between the two
countries.

``` r
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

The main differences are fresh potatoes, cheese and alcohol consumption.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA can help us make sense of these types of datasets. Let’s see how it
works.

The main function in “base” R is called `prcomp()`. In this case we want
to first transpose our input `x` so the columns are the food types and
the rows are the countries.

head( t(x) )

Fresh potatoes and soft drinks are the most prominent. PC2 mainly tells
us that fresh potatoes and soft drinks are what’s driving the
differences between the countries.
